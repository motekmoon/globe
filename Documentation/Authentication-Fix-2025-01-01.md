# Authentication System Fix - January 1, 2025

## Problem Summary
The Globe application was experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error during user signup, preventing new user registration.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through thorough investigation of Supabase API logs and database logs, we identified the issue:

1. **Environment Variables Issue**: The app was running in development mode despite having Supabase credentials
2. **Database Trigger Conflict**: A database trigger `on_auth_user_created` was calling a function `initialize_user_settings()` that was trying to access a non-existent `user_settings` table

## Technical Details

### Issue 1: Development Mode Logic
**Problem**: The `isDevelopment` logic in `src/lib/supabase.ts` was checking both `NODE_ENV` and credentials:
```typescript
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && !hasSupabaseCredentials
```

**Solution**: Changed to prioritize credentials over NODE_ENV:
```typescript
const isDevelopment = !hasSupabaseCredentials
```

### Issue 2: Database Trigger Conflict
**Problem**: Supabase database had a trigger `on_auth_user_created` that automatically called `initialize_user_settings()` function during user signup, but this function was trying to insert into a non-existent `user_settings` table.

**Error in Supabase Logs**:
```
relation "user_settings" does not exist
PL/pgSQL function public.initialize_user_settings() line 3 at SQL statement
```

**Solution**: Removed the problematic trigger and function:
```sql
DROP FUNCTION public.initialize_user_settings() CASCADE;
```

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Fixed development mode logic
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Removed user email from console logs for security
- `src/components/auth/AuthModal.tsx` - Fixed Chakra UI component issues

## Verification
✅ User signup works without 500 errors  
✅ Email verification process works  
✅ User sign-in works  
✅ Full authentication workflow validated  

## Database Schema
The following tables and functions were created for the authentication system:
- `user_metrics` table for analytics tracking
- `get_user_stats` function for user statistics
- RLS policies for user-specific data access
- Updated `locations` table with `user_id` column

## Security Improvements
- Removed user email addresses from console logs
- Implemented proper RLS policies for user data isolation
- Added user-specific data access controls

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
Authentication system is now fully functional with proper Supabase integration.
